## ADR-001: Use Hexagonal Architecture for Backend

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Level 4 enterprise project with 83 stories requires maintainable, testable architecture
- Future complexity anticipated (price scraping pipeline, potential microservices extraction)
- Team needs clear boundaries between business logic and infrastructure

**Decision:**
Implement hexagonal architecture (ports & adapters) with strict layer separation:
- **Domain Layer**: Pure business logic (QAPS calculation, cost estimation)
- **Application Layer**: Use cases orchestrating domain services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Framework adapters (EF Core, Redis, ASP.NET)
- **API Layer**: HTTP entry points delegating to application services

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Domain logic testable without database/HTTP mocks (fast unit tests)
- ✅ Easy to swap PostgreSQL → MongoDB or add GraphQL without touching domain
- ✅ Clear ownership: Domain experts own core logic, engineers own infrastructure
- ❌ More boilerplate than Rails scaffolding (mitigated by code generators)
- ❌ Learning curve for junior developers (mitigated by examples in tech specs)

**Implementation:**
- Domain interfaces: `IModelRepository`, `ICacheRepository`, `IBenchmarkRepository`
- Infrastructure implements: `ModelRepository` (EF Core), `RedisCacheService`
- No domain dependencies on EntityFramework or ASP.NET

## ADR-002: SPA (React) Over SSR (Next.js)

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Platform is data-intensive comparison tool, not content marketing site
- No SEO requirements (models table not indexed by Google)
- Performance critical for filtering/sorting 100+ models
- Future mobile app and public API planned

**Decision:**
Build React SPA with separate .NET API (not Next.js SSR monolith)

**Rationale:**
- Client-side filtering/sorting faster than server round-trips for 100 models
- Clean API boundary enables future mobile apps, desktop clients, public API
- Team expertise in React + .NET
- SSR adds deployment complexity without value for authenticated dashboards

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Instant filtering (<100ms) - no server latency
- ✅ API reusable for mobile/desktop (Phase 2+)
- ✅ Independent frontend/backend deployments
- ❌ Larger initial bundle (mitigated by code splitting)
- ❌ No SSR for first paint (acceptable - not content site)

**Performance Strategy:**
- Code splitting: React.lazy for admin panel, comparison view
- Multi-layer caching: Client (5min) → Redis (1hr) → PostgreSQL
- Optimistic UI updates for admin mutations

---

## ADR-003: Monorepo for Frontend + Backend

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Coordinated frontend/backend development (API contracts change together)
- 1-2 developer team initially
- Need atomic commits across frontend/backend

**Decision:**
Single monorepo with `/backend` and `/frontend` folders (not polyrepo)

**Rationale:**
- Atomic commits for API contract changes (update C# DTO + TypeScript interface in one commit)
- Shared CI/CD pipeline
- Easier for small team (single git clone)
- Coordinated versioning (no drift between frontend/backend)

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Single git clone for entire project
- ✅ No version drift (frontend always compatible with backend)
- ✅ Shared CI/CD (test both in single pipeline)
- ❌ Larger repo size (mitigated by .gitignore, sparse checkout)
- ❌ No independent release cycles (acceptable for MVP)

**Future Reconsideration:**
- If team grows >5 developers → evaluate polyrepo
- If mobile app added → separate repo (different release cycle)
- If API opens publicly → consider API versioning repo

---

## ADR-004: TanStack Query for Server State (Not Redux)

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Server state (API responses) has different concerns than client state (UI toggles)
- Need caching, background refetch, optimistic updates
- Redux overkill for this use case (no complex app-wide state machines)

**Decision:**
- **Server state:** TanStack Query (API data, caching, refetch)
- **Client state:** Zustand (comparison basket, filters, UI preferences)

**Rationale:**
- Server state auto-caching, background refetch, stale-while-revalidate built-in
- Zustand simpler than Redux for UI state (no actions/reducers boilerplate)
- Clear separation: TanStack Query for API, Zustand for client

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Less boilerplate (no actions/reducers for every API call)
- ✅ Automatic cache invalidation on mutations
- ✅ Optimistic updates for admin forms (instant UI feedback)
- ❌ Two state libraries (mitigated by clear responsibility split)

**Configuration:**
```typescript
// TanStack Query: 5min stale time (client-side cache)
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: { queries: { staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000 } }
})

// Zustand: Minimal global state
interface AppState {
  selectedModels: Model[]
  filterState: FilterCriteria
  viewPreferences: ViewPrefs
}
```

## ADR-005: Multi-Layer Caching (Client → Redis → PostgreSQL)

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- NFR002: Scale to 10K+ users without performance degradation
- NFR001: <2s page load, <100ms calculations
- High read:write ratio (1000:1 reads vs admin updates)
- Expensive operations: QAPS calculation (iterate all benchmarks)

**Decision:**
Implement 3-layer caching strategy:
1. **Layer 1 (Client):** TanStack Query - 5min stale time
2. **Layer 2 (API):** Redis - 1hr TTL for API responses
3. **Layer 3 (Computed):** Redis - 1hr TTL for QAPS scores
4. **Source of Truth:** PostgreSQL

**Invalidation Strategy:**
- Admin updates model → Invalidate: Redis keys `cache:models:*`, `cache:bestvalue:*`, `cache:qaps:{id}:*`
- Pub/sub for multi-instance cache invalidation (future)

**Consequences:**
- ✅ 80%+ cache hit rate reduces DB load 5x
- ✅ <2s page load even with 100+ models
- ✅ Instant UI updates (client cache serves stale data while background refetch)
- ❌ Cache invalidation complexity (mitigated by domain events)
- ❌ Redis cost (mitigated by Upstash free tier: 10K cmds/day sufficient for MVP)

**Performance Metrics:**
- Cache hit ratio target: >80%
- Cache miss penalty: <200ms (DB query + computation + cache write)
- Redis latency: <10ms (Upstash or local)

## ADR-006: PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB for Time-Series Pricing

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Phase 2 requires price history tracking (automated scraping)
- Time-series data: price changes over time
- Need efficient queries: "average price over 30 days", "price trend"

**Decision:**
Use TimescaleDB extension on PostgreSQL (not separate time-series DB)

**Rationale:**
- Single database simplifies operations (no multi-DB transactions)
- TimescaleDB hypertables optimize time-series queries
- PostgreSQL already chosen for transactional data (models, benchmarks)
- Hypertables auto-partition by time, compress old data

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Unified database for OLTP + time-series
- ✅ Continuous aggregates for "avg price over 30 days"
- ✅ Data compression (10x reduction for historical pricing)
- ❌ Less specialized than InfluxDB/Prometheus (acceptable for price data, not IoT metrics)

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE model_pricing_history (
  time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  model_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES models(id),
  input_price_per_1m DECIMAL(10,6),
  output_price_per_1m DECIMAL(10,6),
  PRIMARY KEY (time, model_id)
);
SELECT create_hypertable('model_pricing_history', 'time');
```

## ADR-007: MassTransit for Future Message-Driven Architecture

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Phase 2 automated scraping requires job queues, saga coordination
- Scraping workflow: Schedule → Fetch URLs → Validate → Store → Cache invalidation
- Need retry policies, outbox pattern (eventual consistency)

**Decision:**
Integrate MassTransit with Redis transport (MVP), prepare for RabbitMQ/AWS SQS

**Rationale:**
- Broker abstraction (swap Redis → RabbitMQ → AWS SQS without code changes)
- Built-in patterns: Retry policies, saga support, outbox pattern
- Simpler than raw RabbitMQ (less boilerplate)

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Future-proof for event-driven architecture
- ✅ Outbox pattern ensures eventual consistency (save model + publish event atomically)
- ✅ Saga support for multi-step workflows (fetch → validate → store with rollback)
- ❌ Complexity for MVP (mitigated by deferring to Phase 2)

**Future Workflows:**
- Price scraping: `SchedulePriceScrapeCommand → FetchPricesCommand → ValidatePricesCommand → StorePricesCommand → InvalidateCacheEvent`
- Benchmark updates: `UpdateBenchmarkCommand → RecalculateQAPSCommand → InvalidateCacheEvent`

## ADR-008: JWT for Admin Auth (MVP), No OAuth

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- Admin panel needs authentication
- No user accounts for public site (read-only)
- 1-3 admin users for MVP

**Decision:**
Simple JWT tokens for admin auth (HttpOnly cookies), no OAuth/OIDC for MVP

**Rationale:**
- Low complexity (1-3 admin users, manual user management)
- No need for social login, MFA, password reset flows
- HttpOnly cookies + JWT sufficient for MVP security

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Minimal implementation (1 story: Story 2.1)
- ✅ No third-party dependency (Auth0, Okta)
- ✅ Standard JWT claims (user ID, role, expiry)
- ❌ Manual user management (acceptable for 1-3 admins)
- ❌ No MFA (defer to post-MVP if needed)

**Implementation:**
```csharp
[ApiController, Authorize]
public class AdminModelsController : ControllerBase
{
    // JWT middleware validates token
}
```

**Future:** If user accounts added (Phase 2+), evaluate Auth0/Firebase Auth for public users

## ADR-009: QAPS Algorithm for Smart Filter

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- FR016: Implement "Best Value" smart filter
- Need algorithm to rank models by cost-effectiveness
- Benchmarks have different scales (0-100, 0-1, 0-10)

**Decision:**
Implement QAPS (Quality-Adjusted Price per Score) algorithm:
```
QAPS = Composite Quality Score / Total Price

Where:
  Composite Quality Score = Σ (Normalized Benchmark Score × Weight)
  Normalized Score = (Score - Min) / (Max - Min)
  Weights: Reasoning 30%, Code 25%, Math 20%, Language 15%, Multimodal 10%
```

**Rationale:**
- Normalizes benchmarks to 0-1 scale (comparable across different metrics)
- Weighted average reflects importance (reasoning > multimodal for typical use cases)
- Division by price rewards cost-effectiveness

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Explainable algorithm (users understand why model ranked #1)
- ✅ Configurable weights (adjust per use case in future)
- ✅ Handles edge cases: Free models (separate ranking), missing benchmarks (<3 excluded)
- ❌ Weights subjective (mitigated by transparency - show weights in UI)
- ❌ Doesn't account for specific use cases (mitigated by future custom filters)

**Cache Strategy:**
- Compute QAPS on model update, cache in Redis (1hr TTL)
- Pre-compute for all models, serve `/api/smart-filters/best-value` from cache

## ADR-010: Expert Output Mode (Concise Architecture)

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2025-10-16

**Context:**
- User (Pablo) has expert-level React + .NET experience
- Requested concise, decision-focused architecture documentation
- No need for beginner explanations or verbose rationale

**Decision:**
Generate solution architecture in **expert mode**:
- Concise technology decisions (no "why TypeScript" explanations)
- Code samples ≤10 lines (illustrative, not tutorial)
- Focus on design patterns, not implementation details
- Assume familiarity with: Hexagonal architecture, EF Core, React hooks, caching strategies

**Consequences:**
- ✅ Faster documentation consumption (skip basics)
- ✅ Higher information density (more decisions per page)
- ✅ Focus on novel decisions (QAPS algorithm, caching layers)
- ❌ Less onboarding-friendly for junior devs (mitigated by detailed tech specs)

**Output Characteristics:**
- Technology table: Versions + justification, no tutorials
- API contracts: TypeScript interfaces, no explanation
- Database schema: SQL DDL, no ORM basics

---
