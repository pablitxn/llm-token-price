- TestContainers 3.6.0 for Docker-based integration tests
- Playwright 1.40.0 for E2E tests
- Respawn 6.1.0 for database cleanup between integration tests

**Environment:**

- Docker Desktop for local PostgreSQL and Redis containers
- .NET 8 SDK for backend development
- Node.js 20+ and pnpm for frontend development
- GitHub Actions runners for CI/CD

## Quality Gate Criteria

### Pass/Fail Thresholds

- **P0 pass rate**: 100% (no exceptions)
- **P1 pass rate**: ≥95% (waivers required for failures)
- **P2/P3 pass rate**: ≥90% (informational)
- **High-risk mitigations**: 100% complete or approved waivers

### Coverage Targets

- **Critical infrastructure paths**: ≥80% (database schema, API health, cache connection)
- **Hexagonal architecture boundaries**: 100% (domain layer isolation)
- **Entity relationships**: ≥90% (EF Core configuration)
- **CI/CD pipelines**: 100% (build, test, deploy validation)

### Non-Negotiable Requirements

- [ ] All P0 tests pass
- [ ] No high-risk (≥6) items unmitigated
- [ ] Database schema validated (migration up/down tested)
- [ ] Hexagonal architecture boundaries enforced (dependency analyzer)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline executes successfully
- [ ] Docker Compose stack operational

## Mitigation Plans

### R-001: Database Schema Design Flaws (Score: 9)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Schema review session with Tech Lead before first migration
2. Unit tests for all Entity Framework Core entity configurations
3. Integration tests for entity relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many)
4. Migration rollback tests to validate reversibility
5. Data validation scripts post-migration

**Owner:** Backend Dev
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 1 (before any migrations to production)
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:** All entity relationship tests pass, migration up/down executes cleanly, schema review approved

---

### R-002: Hexagonal Architecture Boundaries Violated (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Implement ArchUnitNET tests to enforce dependency rules
2. Code review checklist for architecture violations
3. Domain layer has zero dependencies on infrastructure packages
4. Use interfaces (ports) for all external dependencies

**Owner:** Tech Lead
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 1 (immediate)
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:** ArchUnit tests pass, code review checklist enforced

---

### R-003: EF Core Migration Breaks Schema Integrity (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Always test migrations against a copy of production data
2. Migration rollback tests (up → down → up)
3. Data validation queries pre/post migration
4. Backup database before applying migrations

**Owner:** Backend Dev
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 1 (before first migration)
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:** Migration up/down tests pass, data validation queries return expected results

---

### R-004: CI/CD Pipeline Misconfigured (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Pipeline smoke tests run on every commit
2. Deployment validation tests verify artifacts
3. Rollback procedures documented and tested
4. Parallel test execution with sharding
5. Build cache configured to reduce build times

**Owner:** DevOps
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 2 (after initial pipeline setup)
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:** Pipeline executes successfully, deployment completes in <5 minutes, rollback procedure tested

---

### R-005: Redis Cache Connection Fails in Production (Score: 6)

**Mitigation Strategy:**
1. Health check endpoint validates Redis connectivity
2. Fallback to database if Redis unavailable (graceful degradation)
3. Circuit breaker pattern for Redis operations
4. Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
5. Monitoring alerts for Redis connection failures

**Owner:** Backend Dev
**Timeline:** Sprint 1 Week 2 (after Redis integration)
**Status:** Planned
**Verification:** Health check tests pass, fallback behavior validated, circuit breaker integration tested

## Assumptions and Dependencies

### Assumptions

1. Development team has .NET 8, Node.js 20+, Docker Desktop installed
2. PostgreSQL 16 and Redis 7.2 are available via Docker Compose
3. GitHub Actions runners have necessary permissions for CI/CD
4. Team is familiar with xUnit, Entity Framework Core, and Playwright
5. Hexagonal Architecture pattern is understood and agreed upon
6. Sample data seed script is based on 5-10 real LLM models

### Dependencies

1. **PostgreSQL and Redis Docker images** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 1
2. **Entity Framework Core 9.0** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 1
3. **TestContainers NuGet package** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 1 (integration tests)
4. **GitHub Actions workflow YAML templates** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 2
5. **Vite and React setup** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 1
6. **Tech Lead architecture review availability** - Required by Sprint 1 Week 1 (schema design, hexagonal boundaries)

### Risks to Plan

- **Risk**: Database migration execution fails in CI/CD environment
  - **Impact**: Blocks deployment pipeline, delays Epic 1 completion
  - **Contingency**: Manual migration execution, rollback to previous version, schema validation scripts

- **Risk**: Docker Compose services fail to start on developer machines (OS compatibility)
  - **Impact**: Delays development, inconsistent environments
  - **Contingency**: Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL/Redis alternatives (Supabase, Upstash), Docker troubleshooting guide

- **Risk**: Hexagonal architecture tests create false positives (overly strict dependency rules)
  - **Impact**: Developer friction, slower development velocity
  - **Contingency**: Adjust ArchUnitNET rules, code review override process, whitelist acceptable violations
