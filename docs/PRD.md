# LLM Cost Comparison Platform Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** Pablo
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Project Level:** 4 (Enterprise Scale)
**Target Scale:** 5,000+ monthly active users by month 6

---

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- **Enable data-driven model selection** that reduces LLM operational costs by 15-40% for development teams
- **Eliminate manual research overhead** reducing model evaluation time from 3-5 hours to under 15 minutes per project
- **Provide cost forecasting accuracy** enabling teams to budget AI infrastructure spending with <10% variance
- **Deliver algorithm-driven insights** that answer "which model should I use?" not just "what models exist?"
- **Establish platform as go-to resource** for LLM cost intelligence with 5,000+ monthly active users within 6 months
- **Build foundation for sustainable growth** validating MVP hypothesis before investing in advanced automation
- **Create competitive moat** through unique combination of pricing intelligence, smart algorithms, and visualization depth

**Epic 1 Achievement:** ✅ Complete foundation delivered (11 stories, 37 points) with 42 passing tests, hexagonal architecture validated, API performance exceeding targets (306ms vs <2s requirement)

### Background Context

The explosion of LLM adoption has created an urgent need for cost optimization tools. As of 2025, over 50 commercial and open-source LLMs compete across different pricing models, with new models launching monthly and prices changing frequently. Development teams face a critical challenge: selecting cost-effective models while meeting quality requirements.

Currently, developers waste hours manually comparing scattered pricing information, leading to suboptimal choices that can cost organizations $5K-$50K+ annually in unnecessary LLM spend. Existing solutions—provider websites, manual spreadsheets, basic comparison sites—fail to provide the depth of analysis needed for confident decision-making.

This platform addresses that gap by combining three capabilities rarely found together: always-current pricing data, algorithm-driven decision support, and interactive visual analysis. The MVP focuses on validating core value delivery—comparison tables, cost calculation, and one smart filter—before investing in complex automation infrastructure.
