# Story 2.8: Create Delete Model Functionality

Status: Done

## Story

As an administrator,
I want to delete models,
so that I can remove outdated or incorrect entries.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Delete button triggers confirmation dialog
2. DELETE `/api/admin/models/{id}` endpoint created
3. Endpoint soft-deletes model (sets is_active=false) or hard-deletes
4. Associated capabilities and benchmark scores handled (cascade delete or set inactive)
5. Success refreshes models list with confirmation message

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Soft-Delete vs Hard-Delete:**
- **Soft-delete (Recommended for MVP):**
  - Set `is_active = false` instead of removing row
  - Preserves data for audit trail and recovery
  - Public API excludes inactive models (WHERE is_active=true)
  - Admin can view/recover deleted models (optional)
  - Benchmark scores and pricing history preserved
- **Hard-delete (Future consideration):**
  - Permanently removes model from database
  - Cascade deletes capabilities and benchmark scores
  - Used for test data or duplicate entries
  - Requires admin superuser permission

**Delete Flow:**
```
Delete button click
  → Confirmation dialog
  → User confirms
  → DELETE /api/admin/models/{id}
  → Set is_active=false
  → Update updated_at timestamp
  → Invalidate cache
  → Audit log
  → Return 204
  → Refresh models list
  → Show success toast
```

**Associated Data Handling:**
- ModelCapabilities: Keep (or set is_active=false if column exists)
- BenchmarkScores: Keep (historical data valuable)
- PricingHistory: Keep (Phase 2 feature)
- Cache: Invalidate all models-related cache keys

### Implementation Details

**ConfirmDialog Component:**
```typescript
interface ConfirmDialogProps {
  open: boolean
  onClose: () => void
  onConfirm: () => void
  title: string
  message: string
  confirmText?: string
  loading?: boolean
}

export function ConfirmDialog({
  open,
  onClose,
  onConfirm,
  title,
  message,
  confirmText = 'Confirm',
  loading = false
}: ConfirmDialogProps) {
  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onClose={onClose}>
      <DialogHeader>{title}</DialogHeader>
      <DialogBody>{message}</DialogBody>
      <DialogFooter>
        <Button variant="secondary" onClick={onClose} disabled={loading}>
          Cancel
        </Button>
        <Button
          variant="destructive"
          onClick={onConfirm}
          loading={loading}
        >
          {confirmText}
        </Button>
      </DialogFooter>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```

**Delete Handler in ModelList:**
```typescript
export function ModelList() {
  const [deleteDialog, setDeleteDialog] = useState<{ id: string, name: string } | null>(null)
  const deleteMutation = useDeleteModel()

  const handleDeleteClick = (model: Model) => {
    setDeleteDialog({ id: model.id, name: model.name })
  }

  const handleConfirmDelete = async () => {
    if (!deleteDialog) return

    await deleteMutation.mutateAsync(deleteDialog.id, {
      onSuccess: () => {
        toast.success(`Model '${deleteDialog.name}' deleted successfully`)
        setDeleteDialog(null)
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to delete model')
      }
    })
  }

  return (
    <>
      <table>
        {/* ... table content */}
        <button onClick={() => handleDeleteClick(model)}>Delete</button>
      </table>

      <ConfirmDialog
        open={!!deleteDialog}
        onClose={() => setDeleteDialog(null)}
        onConfirm={handleConfirmDelete}
        title="Delete Model"
        message={`Are you sure you want to delete '${deleteDialog?.name}'? This action cannot be undone.`}
        confirmText="Delete"
        loading={deleteMutation.isPending}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

**DELETE Endpoint:**
```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
[Authorize]
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status204NoContent)]
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status404NotFound)]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteModel(Guid id)
{
    var result = await _adminModelService.DeleteModelAsync(id);

    if (!result)
        return NotFound(new { error = new { message = "Model not found" } });

    return NoContent();
}
```

**DeleteModelAsync Service:**
```csharp
public async Task<bool> DeleteModelAsync(Guid id)
{
    // 1. Fetch model
    var model = await _modelRepo.GetByIdAsync(id);
    if (model == null || !model.IsActive)
        return false;

    // 2. Capture before state for audit
    var beforeState = _mapper.Map<ModelResponseDto>(model);

    // 3. Soft-delete: set is_active = false
    model.IsActive = false;
    model.UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;

    // 4. Optional: soft-delete capabilities (if is_active column exists)
    // model.Capabilities.IsActive = false;

    // 5. Save changes
    await _modelRepo.SaveChangesAsync();

    // 6. Invalidate cache
    await _cache.RemoveAsync($"cache:model:{id}:v1");
    await _cache.RemovePatternAsync("cache:models:*");
    await _cache.RemovePatternAsync("cache:bestvalue:*");

    // 7. Audit log
    await _auditLog.LogAsync(new AuditLogEntry
    {
        AdminUser = GetCurrentUsername(),
        Action = "SOFT_DELETE",
        EntityType = "MODEL",
        EntityId = id,
        ChangesJson = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new { before = beforeState })
    });

    return true;
}
```

**Public API Filter (Existing GET /api/models):**
```csharp
// In ModelQueryService or ModelRepository
public async Task<List<Model>> GetActiveModelsAsync()
{
    return await _dbContext.Models
        .Where(m => m.IsActive == true)  // Exclude soft-deleted
        .Include(m => m.Capabilities)
        .ToListAsync();
}
```

**Recovery Endpoint (Optional):**
```csharp
[HttpPut("{id}/recover")]
[Authorize]
public async Task<IActionResult> RecoverModel(Guid id)
{
    var model = await _modelRepo.GetByIdAsync(id);
    if (model == null)
        return NotFound();

    model.IsActive = true;
    model.UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
    await _modelRepo.SaveChangesAsync();

    await InvalidateCache();

    return Ok(new { message = "Model recovered successfully" });
}
```

### Testing Strategy

**Component Tests:**
- Delete button click opens confirmation dialog
- Dialog displays correct model name
- Cancel closes dialog without calling mutation
- Confirm calls delete mutation with correct ID
- Success shows toast and closes dialog
- Error shows error toast

**Unit Tests:**
- DeleteModelAsync sets is_active to false
- DeleteModelAsync updates updated_at timestamp
- DeleteModelAsync returns false for non-existent model
- DeleteModelAsync creates audit log entry

**Integration Tests:**
- DELETE /api/admin/models/{id} returns 204 on success
- Model.is_active set to false in database
- DELETE with non-existent ID returns 404
- Deleted model excluded from public GET /api/models
- Deleted model still accessible via admin GET (with filter)
- Cache invalidated after delete
- Audit log entry created with before state

**E2E Test:**
- Admin logs in → navigates to models → clicks delete → confirms → model removed from list → success toast shown

### Completion Notes List

1. **Most infrastructure already implemented**: The DELETE endpoint, soft-delete logic, API filters, and mutation hooks were all previously implemented in earlier stories. Only the ConfirmDialog component and integration needed to be added.

2. **Soft-delete pattern confirmed**: The implementation uses `IsActive = false` for soft-deletes, preserving data integrity while hiding models from the public API. The public `ModelRepository` filters by `m.IsActive` (lines 37 and 51), while the admin API can view all models.

3. **Testing coverage complete**: Added 12 comprehensive tests for the ConfirmDialog component covering all user interactions, loading states, and accessibility features. Backend E2E tests for DELETE operations were already in place.

4. **Deferred features**: Audit logging, model recovery, and "Show Deleted" toggle were deferred as they're not MVP requirements.

5. **Test improvements by TEA agent (Murat)**: Added critical E2E test `DeleteModel_SoftDeleted_Should_BeExcludedFromPublicAPI` that validates soft-deleted models are excluded from public API (`GET /api/models`). This test discovered and fixed a bug where `DeleteModelAsync` wasn't checking if a model was already inactive before attempting soft-delete. Fixed by adding `|| !model.IsActive` check in `AdminModelRepository.DeleteModelAsync` (line 96). Test count increased from 137 to 138 tests (all passing).
