# Story 1.7: Setup Frontend Application Shell

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer,
I want React application initialized with routing, state management, and layout structure,
So that I can begin building UI components and pages.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. React application entry point (main.tsx) configured with React Query and React Router providers
2. App component created with route configuration for HomePage, CalculatorPage, and ComparisonPage components
3. Layout component created with header, footer, and main content area structure
4. Global styles configured with TailwindCSS imports and custom CSS variables for design system
5. Frontend dev server starts successfully and displays working homepage at http://localhost:5173
6. API client utility created for making HTTP requests to backend with base URL configuration
7. **[EXPANDED SCOPE]** HomePage displays model listings with API integration (useQuery hook, model cards with pricing/capabilities/benchmarks)
8. **[EXPANDED SCOPE]** API models endpoint integration (`fetchModels` function in api/models.ts)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Constraints

**From solution-architecture.md Section 2.3 - Client-Side Architecture:**
- **Component hierarchy:** App → Layout → Pages → Components
- **State architecture:**
  - Global state (Zustand) for selected models, filter state, view preferences
  - Server state (TanStack Query) for API data with 5-minute stale time
  - Local component state (useState) for form inputs, modals
- **Routing:** React Router 6.21.0 with standard SPA routing

**From solution-architecture.md Section 1.1 - Technology Stack:**
- **React:** 18.2.0 with concurrent rendering features
- **React Router:** 6.21.0 for client-side routing
- **TanStack Query:** 5.17.0 for server state management
- **Axios:** 1.6.0 for HTTP client
- **TailwindCSS:** 3.4.0 for styling (already configured in Story 1.2)

**From tech-spec-epic-1.md Story 1.7:**
- **main.tsx structure:** QueryClient with 5min staleTime, BrowserRouter wrapper, StrictMode enabled
- **App.tsx routes:** / (HomePage), /calculator (CalculatorPage), /compare (ComparisonPage)
- **Layout component:** Header + main content + Footer structure

└── index.html (entry HTML)
```

**main.tsx implementation:**
```typescript
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import App from './App'
import './styles/globals.css'

const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      retry: 1,
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
    },
  },
})

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <BrowserRouter>
        <App />
      </BrowserRouter>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

**App.tsx implementation:**
```typescript
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
import Layout from './components/layout/Layout'
import HomePage from './pages/HomePage'
import CalculatorPage from './pages/CalculatorPage'
import ComparisonPage from './pages/ComparisonPage'
import NotFoundPage from './pages/NotFoundPage'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/calculator" element={<CalculatorPage />} />
        <Route path="/compare" element={<ComparisonPage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

**Layout.tsx implementation:**
```typescript
import { ReactNode } from 'react'
import Header from './Header'
import Footer from './Footer'

interface LayoutProps {
  children: ReactNode
}

export default function Layout({ children }: LayoutProps) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col bg-neutral-50">
      <Header />
      <main className="flex-1 container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
        {children}
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**API client.ts implementation:**
```typescript
import axios from 'axios'

export const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: '/api', // Vite proxy forwards to http://localhost:5000/api
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
})

// Request interceptor (placeholder for future auth)
apiClient.interceptors.request.use(
  (config) => {
    // Add auth token here when implemented
    return config
  },
  (error) => Promise.reject(error)
)

// Response interceptor (error handling)
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  (error) => {
    console.error('API Error:', error.response?.data || error.message)
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
)
```

### Testing Standards Summary

**Frontend application validation:**
1. Dev server test: `npm run dev` starts without errors on port 5173
2. Homepage test: Navigate to http://localhost:5173, verify placeholder content renders
3. Routing test: Click navigation links, verify URL changes and correct page loads
4. API connectivity test: Browser console fetch to `/api/health` succeeds
5. Hot reload test: Edit component, verify changes appear immediately
6. No console errors: Check for React warnings, network errors, Tailwind issues

**Component rendering validation:**
1. Layout renders: Header visible at top, Footer at bottom, main content in between
2. Navigation works: Links change routes without full page reload
3. 404 handling: Navigate to invalid route, verify NotFoundPage renders
4. Tailwind styles apply: Verify fonts, colors, spacing classes work

**Quality gates:**
- Initial page load: <2 seconds
- Route navigation: <100ms
- Dev server HMR: <500ms
- No React strict mode warnings
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Prerequisites from previous stories:**
- Story 1.1: Frontend directory created with Vite + React + TypeScript
- Story 1.2: All frontend packages installed (React Router, React Query, axios, TailwindCSS)
- Story 1.2: Vite configured with proxy to backend

**No new dependencies** (all packages already installed in Story 1.2)

**Common issues and solutions:**
1. **Port 5173 already in use**: Kill existing Vite process or change port in vite.config.ts
2. **API connection fails**: Verify backend running on port 5000, check Vite proxy configuration
3. **Tailwind classes not working**: Verify globals.css imported in main.tsx
4. **React Router 404 on refresh**: Dev server should handle this automatically (Vite config)
5. **TypeScript errors on components**: Verify tsconfig.json configured correctly from Story 1.2

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Pablo
**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Outcome:** Approved (with scope expansion accepted)
**Resolution Date:** 2025-10-16

### Summary

Story 1.7 successfully implements the React application shell with routing, state management providers, layout structure, and API client configuration. All 6 acceptance criteria are technically satisfied. However, the implementation includes significant scope expansion beyond the original story requirements—specifically, the HomePage evolved from a "placeholder" component into a fully functional model listing page with API integration, which appears to overlap with future story deliverables (Story 1.10 or Epic 3).

### Key Findings

**High Severity:**

1. **Scope Creep - HomePage Implementation** (apps/web/src/pages/HomePage.tsx:1-110)
   - Story AC specifies "placeholder homepage" but implementation includes full API integration with `useQuery`, model cards with pricing/capabilities/benchmarks
   - This overlaps with Story 1.10 (GET API for Models) and Epic 3 stories (Public Comparison Table)
   - **Risk:** Future stories may require rework; unclear what remains to be implemented
   - **Recommendation:** Either (a) update story acceptance criteria to reflect expanded scope and mark dependent stories as partially complete, OR (b) simplify HomePage to true placeholder and move model display to appropriate future story

2. **Missing API File Documentation** (apps/web/src/pages/HomePage.tsx:2)
   - HomePage imports `fetchModels` from '../api/models' but this file isn't listed in story's File List
   - File exists (confirmed), suggesting incomplete documentation
   - **Recommendation:** Add `apps/web/src/api/models.ts` to Dev Agent Record → File List section

**Medium Severity:**

3. **Version Mismatches vs Tech Spec** (apps/web/package.json)
   - React: Spec calls for 18.2.0, implemented 19.1.1 (major version ahead)
   - React Router: Spec 6.21.0, implemented 7.9.4 (major version ahead)
   - TanStack Query: Spec 5.17.0, implemented 5.90.5 (minor upgrade acceptable)
   - Zustand: Spec 4.4.7, implemented 5.0.8 (major version ahead)
   - **Risk:** Breaking changes in major versions, team alignment issues
   - **Recommendation:** Document version upgrade decisions in architecture-decisions.md or revert to spec versions

4. **Missing Font Loading** (apps/web/src/styles/globals.css:42)
   - globals.css references Inter/JetBrains Mono fonts but no `@import` or `<link>` tag configured
   - Fonts will fall back to system fonts (functional but not per design spec)
   - **Recommendation:** Add Google Fonts import or local font files

**Low Severity:**

5. **Test Coverage Gap** - No unit tests for components (HomePage, Layout, Header, Footer)
   - Story doesn't explicitly require tests, but Level 4 project expectations suggest 70% unit test coverage
   - **Recommendation:** Add Vitest tests for core components in follow-up task

6. **State Documentation Clarity** (Dev Notes)
   - Notes mention "Zustand for client state (not yet implemented)" but zustand package is installed
   - **Recommendation:** Clarify status to avoid confusion

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | React entry point with Query/Router providers | ✅ Met | main.tsx:8-26 correctly configured |
| 2 | App with route configuration | ✅ Met | App.tsx:8-19 with all 4 routes |
| 3 | Layout component with header/footer | ✅ Met | Layout.tsx:9-19 structure correct |
| 4 | Global TailwindCSS styles | ✅ Met | globals.css:1-95 with design system |
| 5 | Dev server starts on :5173 | ✅ Met | Confirmed in completion notes |
| 6 | API client utility | ✅ Met | client.ts:1-32 with interceptors |

**Overall AC Coverage:** 6/6 met, but AC#2 exceeded scope (HomePage not placeholder)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Strengths:**
- TypeScript strict mode validation passed (zero errors)
- ESLint validation passed
- Production build successful (358ms, 83.45KB gzipped - well under quality gates)
- Manual testing completed (routing, dev server, API proxy)

**Gaps:**
1. **No unit tests** for components (HomePage, Layout, Header, Footer) - Story doesn't explicitly require tests, but Level 4 project expectations suggest 70% unit test coverage. Recommend adding Vitest tests in follow-up task.
2. **No E2E tests** for routing and navigation - Acceptance Criteria verified manually but not automated. Recommend adding Playwright smoke test for basic navigation.
3. **No API client error handling tests** - Interceptors exist but edge cases (timeout, network failure, 401/403) not validated. Recommend adding MSW-based tests for client.ts error scenarios.

### Architectural Alignment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Hexagonal architecture respected (no domain logic in UI components)
- ✅ Clean separation: State management (TanStack Query), HTTP client (axios), routing (React Router)
- ✅ Proper provider hierarchy (StrictMode → QueryClient → Router → App)
- ✅ TailwindCSS 4 compatibility fix (`@apply` → vanilla CSS) shows good adaptation

**Concerns:**
1. **State architecture incomplete** - Zustand installed but no store created yet (expected for future stories). Document intent clearly to avoid confusion.
2. **Component organization** - HomePage complexity suggests it should be broken into smaller components (e.g., ModelCard extraction) if it remains in this scope.

### Security Notes

**Low Risk - Production Readiness:**
1. **Auth placeholder commented out** (client.ts:14-18) - Acceptable for MVP, clearly marked. Ensure JWT auth story (Epic 2) removes placeholders.
2. **Console.error for API errors** (client.ts:28) - Dev-friendly but should add structured logging for production (consider Sentry/LogRocket).
3. **No input sanitization** in HomePage model display - Currently safe (trusted backend), but future user-generated content needs XSS protection. Add to security review checklist for Epic 2 (Admin CRUD).
