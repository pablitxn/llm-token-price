## What to do next

**What to do next:** ðŸš€ **Implement Story 3.1b - Technical Debt Consolidation**

**Recommended Action:** Implement Story 3.1b using DEV agent

**Current Story:** Story 3.1b - Consolidated Technical Debt Resolution (Epics 1-2)

**Status:**
- âœ… Story created (20 ACs organized by priority: 4 CRITICAL, 6 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 7 LOW)
- âœ… Story marked ready for development
- âœ… Comprehensive technical debt audit completed (100% coverage verified)
- âœ… Context XML generated (comprehensive implementation guidance)

**Command to run:**
Load DEV agent and run `dev-story` workflow to implement Story 3.1b

**Implementation Guidance:**
- Context file: `docs/stories/story-context-3.1b.xml` (complete with docs, code artifacts, constraints, interfaces, test standards)
- Estimated effort: 21-28 hours across 5 major tasks
- Priority execution: CRITICAL (Week 1) â†’ HIGH (Week 1-2) â†’ MEDIUM (Week 2) â†’ LOW (Backlog)
- Key deliverables: Staging deployment, HTTPS enforcement, documentation (badges, env vars, ADR-011, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE), UX improvements, process automation
- File: `docs/stories/story-3.1b.md`

**Epic 3 Status:**
- All technical debt from Epic 2 resolved (Story 2.13 complete)
- 242 tests passing, 0 failures
- CI/CD pipeline enforcing 95% pass rate and 70% coverage
- Production-ready foundation established
- Epic 3 stories need to be drafted or Story 3.1 context generated

**Epic 2 Remaining Work (Optional/Deferred):**
- Story 2.10: Benchmark Score Entry Form (medium priority)
- Story 2.11: Bulk Benchmark Import via CSV (medium priority)
- These can be completed in parallel with Epic 3 or deferred based on priorities

## Notes

- Project has comprehensive technical specification already prepared
- Level 4 requires Phase 3 (Solutioning) for architecture design before implementation
- UX workflow included due to extensive UI requirements (tables, charts, modals, admin panel)
- Implementation will follow epic-based iterative approach
