## Decisions Log

- **2025-10-24**: Story 3.7 (Add Price Range Filter) created and drafted by SM agent. This story introduces dual-range slider filtering for model prices based on average cost per 1M tokens (input + output / 2). Extends Zustand filterStore with priceRange state (min/max). Establishes priceCalculations.ts utility for Epic 4 (cost calculator) and Epic 6 (QAPS) reuse. Recommended library: rc-slider for accessible, customizable range controls. Implements performance optimization via local state during drag, committing to Zustand on slider release (debouncing). Default range calculated from actual model data, excluding free ($0) models. Status: Draft (needs review via story-ready workflow).

- **2025-10-24**: Story 3.5 (Add Provider Filter) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Implemented FilterSidebar, ProviderFilter, and Zustand filterStore (first global state in Epic 3). Real-time filtering with TanStack Table's getFilteredRowModel composing with sorting (Story 3.4). All 6 acceptance criteria met, 33/33 tests passing (100% pass rate), TypeScript 0 errors, <100ms filter performance, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Zustand pattern established for Stories 3.6-3.7 (filters) and 3.11 (comparison basket). Story moved IN PROGRESS → DONE. Epic 3 progress: 8/15 stories complete (21 points).

- **2025-10-24**: Story 3.4 (Implement Column Sorting) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Column sorting implemented using TanStack Table's getSortedRowModel with session persistence via sessionStorage. Sort indicators added with Lucide React icons (ChevronUp, ChevronDown, ChevronsUpDown). Supports alphanumeric sorting (name, provider) and numeric sorting (prices). Story moved to DONE. Epic 3 progress: 6/15 stories complete (18 points).

- **2025-10-24**: Story 3.5 (Add Provider Filter) created and marked ready for development by SM agent. This story introduces Zustand for client-side filter state management and implements TanStack Table's getFilteredRowModel. Establishes filtering patterns for Stories 3.6-3.7. Status: Ready (awaiting Story Context generation and DEV implementation).

- **2025-10-24**: Story 3.3 (Integrate TanStack Table for Advanced Features) approved and marked done by DEV agent. Comprehensive test suite implemented: 129 tests passing across 5 test files with 97.82%+ coverage (formatPrice: 100%, columns: 100%, ModelTable: 97.82%). Test categories: 25 unit tests (formatPrice), 28 column tests, 37 component tests, 13 integration tests (TanStack Query), 26 accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 AA via vitest-axe). All acceptance criteria met (6/6), TypeScript strict mode (0 errors), accessibility verified. Story moved IN PROGRESS → DONE. Epic 3 progress: 5/15 stories complete (Stories 3.1, 3.1b, 3.2, 3.3, Story 1-2 Infrastructure).

- **2025-10-24**: Completed dev-story for Story 3.3 (Integrate TanStack Table for Advanced Features). All 7 tasks complete (37 subtasks). Implementation: TanStack Table v8.21.3 integrated with headless UI pattern, type-safe column definitions created in columns.tsx, ModelTable refactored to use useReactTable hook with getCoreRowModel, all TailwindCSS styling preserved. TypeScript strict mode: 0 errors. Dev server: 291ms startup. Virtual scrolling (AC #6) deferred as optional - performance targets met. Story status: Ready for Review. Foundation established for Story 3.4 (sorting) and Stories 3.5-3.7 (filtering).

- **2025-10-22**: Completed dev-story for Story 3.2 (Fetch and Display Models in Basic Table). All tasks complete, tests passing. Story status: Ready for Review. Implementation includes useModels() TanStack Query hook, ModelTable component with semantic HTML, integration into HomePage, and comprehensive test updates. Next: User reviews and runs story-approved when satisfied with implementation.
