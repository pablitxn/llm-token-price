# Product Brief: LLM Cost Comparison Platform

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Author:** Pablo
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**LLM Cost Comparison Platform** is a comprehensive web application that solves a critical challenge for AI developers: optimizing LLM costs while selecting the right model for specific use cases.

**The Problem:** Developers and technical decision-makers waste 3-5 hours per project manually researching LLM pricing across scattered provider websites, leading to suboptimal model selection and 15-40% higher operational costs. With 50+ models from multiple providers and pricing structures changing monthly, teams lack the tools to make data-driven, cost-optimized decisions.

**The Solution:** An always-current comparison platform combining automated pricing intelligence, smart decision algorithms ("Best Value," "Cheapest Combo," "Most Intelligent," "State of the Art"), and interactive visualization tools. Users can compare models across pricing, capabilities, and 20+ benchmarks, calculate costs for specific workloads, and receive algorithm-driven recommendations.

**Target Market:** Primary users are backend engineers at startups/scaleups implementing LLM features who need to optimize costs (2-4 evaluations per month). Secondary users are engineering managers and CTOs managing $50K-$500K+ annual AI infrastructure budgets who need strategic cost visibility and control.

**Key Value Proposition:** Unlike static comparison sites or manual spreadsheets, the platform delivers **(1)** data freshness through automation, **(2)** decision intelligence through algorithms, and **(3)** analytical depth through visualization—becoming the definitive tool for LLM selection, not just a pricing directory.

**MVP Scope (6 months):** Launch with 25+ models, sortable comparison tables, cost calculator, one smart filter algorithm, basic visualization, and admin panel with manual updates. Post-MVP phases add automated scraping, complete smart filter suite, advanced charts, and use case matching engine.

**Success Metrics:** 5,000 monthly active users within 6 months, 40% completing cost calculations, 35% 7-day retention rate, validating core hypothesis before investing in advanced automation features.

## Problem Statement

Organizations and developers building LLM-powered applications face a critical challenge: **optimizing AI costs while selecting the right model for their specific use cases**.

Currently, teams waste 3-5 hours per project manually researching LLM pricing across scattered provider websites, outdated documentation, and fragmented benchmark sources. This inefficient process leads to:

- **Suboptimal model selection**: Choosing models based on brand recognition rather than cost-performance fit, resulting in 15-40% higher operational costs
- **Budget uncertainty**: Inability to accurately forecast AI spending due to complex pricing structures (input/output token differences, context window variations)
- **Missed opportunities**: Delayed evaluation of new cost-effective models as dozens of new LLMs launch monthly
- **Analysis paralysis**: Overwhelming complexity when comparing 50+ models across pricing, capabilities, and 20+ benchmark metrics

Existing solutions fail to address this comprehensively. Provider websites offer siloed, biased information. Manual spreadsheets become outdated within days. Existing comparison tools lack advanced features like scenario modeling, smart filtering algorithms, and automated price tracking.

**The market urgency is clear**: As AI adoption accelerates and LLM costs represent growing portions of infrastructure budgets (often $10K-$100K+ monthly for production applications), the ability to make data-driven, cost-optimized model selections is transitioning from "nice-to-have" to business-critical.

## Proposed Solution

**LLM Cost Comparison Platform** is a comprehensive web application that empowers developers and technical decision-makers to make data-driven LLM selections through real-time pricing intelligence, advanced filtering algorithms, and powerful visualization tools.

**Core Approach:**

The platform solves the LLM selection challenge through three integrated capabilities:

1. **Always-Current Pricing Intelligence**
   - Automated price scraping system continuously monitors provider websites
   - Historical price tracking reveals trends and volatility
   - Anomaly detection alerts users to significant price changes
   - Multi-currency support with validity period tracking

2. **Smart Decision Algorithms**
   - "Cheapest Combo" finds optimal cost solutions for specific use cases and volumes
   - "Most Intelligent" ranks models by composite performance across benchmarks
   - "State of the Art" identifies frontier models by category
   - "Best Value" calculates quality-adjusted price per score (QAPS) for ROI optimization
   - Scenario builder models complex workloads with multiple components

3. **Interactive Visual Analysis**
   - Sortable/filterable comparison tables as primary interface
   - Multi-dimensional charts (bar, radar, scatter, heatmap) for deep exploration
   - Side-by-side model comparison with synchronized visualizations
   - Cost calculator with workload-specific estimates
   - Use case matching engine recommends optimal models based on requirements

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Automation-first**: Unlike manual spreadsheets or static sites, pricing updates automatically
- **Algorithm-driven insights**: Smart filters answer "what should I use?" not just "what exists?"
- **Comprehensive benchmarking**: Integrates 20+ academic and practical benchmarks with normalization
- **Production-ready calculations**: Real-world scenario modeling with input/output ratio controls
- **Admin-friendly**: Internal management panel enables rapid updates without developer intervention

**Why This Will Succeed:**

The platform combines three elements rarely found together: **(1) data freshness** through automation, **(2) decision intelligence** through algorithms, and **(3) analytical depth** through visualization. By focusing on the complete decision workflow—from initial discovery to cost forecasting—the platform becomes the definitive tool for LLM selection, not just a pricing directory.

**Ideal User Experience:**

A developer lands on the platform exploring LLM options for a RAG application. Within minutes, they filter by "supports function calling," apply the "Best Value" smart filter, visualize the top 5 candidates on a radar chart comparing reasoning scores, then use the scenario builder to calculate monthly costs at their expected 2M token volume with 70/30 input/output split. They bookmark three finalists and return weekly as new models launch and prices shift.

- Basic model metadata: name, provider, pricing (input/output per 1M tokens)
- Core capabilities flags: context window, function calling, vision support
- 5-8 key benchmarks (MMLU, HumanEval, GSM8K, etc.)

**2. Public Comparison Interface**
- **Sortable/filterable table view** (primary interface)
  - Sort by price, benchmark scores, provider
  - Basic filters: provider, capabilities, price range
- **Model detail modal** with pricing calculator widget
- **Cost calculator**
  - Input: monthly volume, I/O ratio
  - Output: cost per model comparison table

**3. Basic Comparison Features**
- Select 2-5 models for side-by-side comparison
- Comparison table showing pricing + key benchmarks
- **One chart type**: Bar chart for benchmark comparison

**4. Essential Smart Filter** (Pick ONE for MVP)
- "Best Value" algorithm (QAPS calculation) - validates core value prop

**5. Admin Panel - Minimum Viable**
- Add/edit models (basic CRUD)
- Manual pricing updates
- Benchmark entry form
- Simple model list management

**6. Data Updates** (Manual for MVP)
- Admin manually updates pricing from provider sites
- No automated scraping in MVP (Phase 2 feature)

### Out of Scope for MVP

**Deferred to Post-MVP:**

❌ **Automated Price Scraping** - Manual admin updates sufficient for MVP validation
❌ **All 4 Smart Filters** - Start with ONE, add others based on usage
❌ **Advanced Visualizations** - Radar, scatter, heatmap charts (bar chart sufficient for MVP)
❌ **Scenario Builder** - Multi-component workload modeling (complex, defer)
❌ **Historical Price Tracking** - Time-series data adds complexity
❌ **Use Case Matching Engine** - Predefined use cases with scoring algorithms
❌ **Multiple Chart Types in Comparison** - Start with one chart type
❌ **Advanced Admin Features** - Bulk import, scraping config, anomaly detection
❌ **User Accounts/Bookmarking** - Launch as anonymous-use tool first
❌ **API Access** - Focus on web UI for MVP

**Why These Deferrals Make Sense:**
- **Scraping automation**: Manual updates validate whether users care about freshness before investing in complex scraping infrastructure
- **Multiple smart filters**: ONE filter validates the algorithm approach; add more based on which users request most
- **Advanced visualizations**: Bar charts + table prove comparison value; add complexity if users demand it
- **Scenario builder**: Complex feature; simple calculator proves cost calculation value first

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. **Functional completeness**: 25+ models with pricing, capabilities, and benchmarks accessible via working comparison interface
2. **User validation**: 500+ unique users within first month post-launch
