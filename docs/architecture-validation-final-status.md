## Improvements Applied

### 1. Epic Alignment Matrix (CRITICAL - COMPLETED)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**File:** `/docs/epic-alignment-matrix.md`
**Changes:**
- Created comprehensive 515-line epic alignment matrix
- Mapped all 8 epics to architecture components
- Story-level traceability for 83 stories

  - Frontend: React hooks, TypeScript, state management, Vite
  - General: Git, SQL, Docker basics, REST APIs
- Architecture support strategies for intermediate developers
- Learning curve management (4-week onboarding plan)
- Advanced topics deferred to Phase 2

**Impact:** Clarifies skill level assumptions and provides onboarding roadmap

### 3. Validation Documentation (COMPLETED)

## Items NOT Applied (Deferred by Design)

### 1. Detailed Tech Specs for Epics 2-4, 6-8
**Status:** ⚠ DEFERRED (Acceptable)
**Reason:** Generate on-demand as epics enter development
**Current State:**
- Epic 1: ✅ Detailed tech spec exists
- Epic 5: ✅ Detailed tech spec exists (2025-01-17)
- Epics 2-4, 6-8: Summary in `tech-spec-epic-2-8-summary.md`

**Plan:**
- Generate Epic 2 detailed tech spec when Epic 2 stories are drafted
- Generate Epic 3 tech spec before Story 3.1 development (or use existing architecture)
- Remaining epics: Generate as needed

**Impact:** Low - sufficient guidance exists in solution architecture

### 2. Specialist Handoff Documentation
**Status:** ⚠ DEFERRED (Acceptable for MVP)
**Reason:** Post-MVP engagement, inline sections sufficient
**Current State:**
- DevOps handoff: Section 14.1 (lines 1655-1666)
- Security handoff: Section 14.2 (lines 1668-1679)
- Testing handoff: Section 14.3 (lines 1681-1692)

**Plan:**
- Formalize if/when engaging specialist workflows post-MVP
- Current inline documentation sufficient for scaling guidance

**Impact:** Low - handoff sections provide clear deliverables and engagement triggers

### 3. Deployment Strategy Finalization
**Status:** ⚠ DEFERRED (Acceptable for Epic 1-3)
**Reason:** Can finalize before production deployment
**Current State:**
- Section 11.2 (lines 1436-1461) provides 3 options with pros/cons
- Option 1: Single VPS (simple, low cost)
- Option 2: Vercel + Railway (recommended for MVP)
- Option 3: AWS/Azure (future enterprise)

**Plan:**
- Finalize during Epic 8 or before production deployment
- Recommendation: Option 2 (Vercel + Railway) for frictionless deployment

**Impact:** None - acceptable placeholder for MVP phase
