## ⚠️ WHAT COULD IMPROVE

### Process Issues
- ⏱️ **Review cycle timing** - Some stories reviewed AFTER subsequent stories completed (out-of-order)
- 📄 **Story Context XML missing** - Flagged in multiple reviews (M1/L1 issues)
- 🧪 **Test-first adoption** - Tests written reactively (after code) rather than proactively (TDD)

### Technical Issues
- 🔴 **Scope creep in Story 1.7** - HomePage exceeded placeholder intent, overlapped with Story 1.10/Epic 3
- 📚 **Missing documentation files** - CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE flagged in Story 1.1 review
- 🧪 **Test coverage gaps** - Stories 1.1-1.6 had minimal unit tests initially
- 🔧 **Redis nullability warning** - Minor build warning in Story 1.1

### Architecture Gaps
- 🔄 **Cache invalidation strategy** - Not implemented in Epic 1 (CRITICAL for Epic 2)
- 🧪 **ArchUnitNET tests late** - Should have been Story 1.2, not Story 1.11
- 📊 **Observability gaps** - Logging configured but monitoring/metrics not implemented
- 🔐 **Security hardening** - Dev credentials OK for Epic 1, need env vars before production

### Testing Gaps
- 🚨 **Late test infrastructure** - Story 1.11 should have been Story 1.2 or 1.3
- 📉 **TDD adoption low** - Most tests written AFTER implementation
- 🔍 **Integration test gaps** - Stories 1.3-1.6 lacked database integration tests initially
- 🎭 **E2E coverage minimal** - Only health endpoint E2E test; need critical user journeys

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### Process Lessons
1. 💡 **Sequential execution with immediate review** prevents workflow confusion
2. 💡 **Story Context XML automation** should be built into story-ready workflow
3. 💡 **ATDD checklists** (like Story 1.11) enforce test-first discipline
4. 💡 **Stick to story scope** - Story 1.7 expansion set precedent for flexibility

### Technical Lessons
1. 💡 **Architecture validation from Story 1** - ArchUnitNET tests should be foundational, not afterthought
2. 💡 **Cache invalidation patterns** must be designed BEFORE admin mutations (Epic 2)
3. 💡 **ADRs for major decisions** - Continue for version upgrades, tech choices, architecture patterns
4. 💡 **Version upgrades mid-epic** require ADR documentation and impact assessment

### Testing Lessons
1. 💡 **Test infrastructure is not optional** - Should be Story 1.1 prerequisite, not Story 1.11 afterthought
2. 💡 **ATDD checklists enforce discipline** - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle
3. 💡 **TestContainers + Respawn** provides fast, isolated integration tests
4. 💡 **Early full-stack integration** (Story 1.10) validates architecture decisions

## 🚀 NEXT EPIC PREVIEW: Epic 2 - Model Data Management & Admin CRUD

### Dependencies on Epic 1 ✅
- ✅ Backend API structure (Story 1.6)
- ✅ Database models and migrations (Story 1.4)
- ✅ Frontend application shell (Story 1.7)
- ✅ Authentication infrastructure placeholder (ready for Epic 2.1)
- ✅ CRUD repositories pattern established (Story 1.10)

### Preparation Needed ⚠️
- 📦 JWT authentication libraries (System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt, BCrypt.Net)
- 📦 Form validation (FluentValidation backend, React Hook Form + Zod frontend)
- 📦 CSV parsing (CsvHelper)
- 📐 Cache invalidation strategy design
- 📐 Admin authentication flow design (ADR)

### Technical Prerequisites ✅
- ✅ All Epic 1 infrastructure complete and tested
- ✅ Database schema supports admin operations
- ✅ API structure ready for admin endpoints
- ✅ Frontend routing ready for admin routes

### Identified Risks ⚠️
- ⚠️ **Cache staleness** - Admin updates pricing → users see old cached prices
- ⚠️ **Authentication complexity** - JWT + HttpOnly cookies + CORS may require iteration
- ⚠️ **Form validation coordination** - Backend + frontend validation must stay in sync
- ⚠️ **Concurrent edits** - Two admins editing same model → need optimistic locking

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PATH FOR EPIC 2

### Must Complete Before Epic 2 Starts:
1. ✅ **Authentication ADR (ADR-011)** - Decide JWT approach
2. ✅ **Cache invalidation strategy** - Design before Story 2.5 creates mutations
3. ✅ **Story Context XML automation** - Prevent M1 findings in every review

### Dependencies Timeline:
```
Prep Sprint (Day 1):
├─ JWT libraries installed → Ready for Story 2.1
├─ Authentication ADR complete → Ready for Story 2.1
├─ Cache invalidation designed → Ready for Story 2.5
└─ Story Context automation → Ready for all Epic 2 stories

Story 2.1 (Day 2): Admin Authentication
└─ Depends on: Authentication ADR, JWT libraries

Stories 2.2-2.4 (Days 3-4): Dashboard, List, Add Form
└─ Depends on: Story 2.1 complete

Story 2.5 (Day 5): Backend API for Adding Models
└─ Depends on: Cache invalidation strategy, FluentValidation
```
