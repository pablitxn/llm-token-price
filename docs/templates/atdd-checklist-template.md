## GREEN Phase: Passing Tests

**Goal:** Write MINIMAL code to make tests pass. Focus on functionality, not perfection.

### Implementation 1: [Component/Service Name]

**Tests Addressed:** Test 1.1, Test 1.2

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Create file:** `path/to/component.tsx`
2. **Implement minimal functionality:**

   - [Step 2: e.g., "Add props interface"]
   - [Step 3: e.g., "Implement render logic"]
3. **Run tests:** Verify Test 1.1 and Test 1.2 now pass

**Implementation Code Snippet:**
```typescript
// Example minimal implementation
export const ComponentName = (props: Props) => {
  // Minimal code to make tests pass
  return <div>{props.value}</div>;
};
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Test 1.1 now passes (üü¢ GREEN)

**Implementation Code Snippet:**
```typescript
// Example service implementation
```

**Validation:**

- [ ] No new failing tests introduced

---

### GREEN Phase Checklist

**GREEN Phase Completion:**
- **Total Tests Passing:** [Number] / [Total]
- **Pass Rate:** [Percentage]%
- **All Acceptance Criteria Met:** ‚úÖ | ‚ùå
- **Ready for REFACTOR Phase:** ‚úÖ | ‚ùå

## REFACTOR Phase: Code Quality Improvements

**Goal:** Improve code quality while KEEPING tests green. Focus on readability, maintainability, performance.

### Refactoring 1: [Improvement Area - e.g., "Extract Reusable Utility"]

**Files Affected:** `path/to/file1.ts`, `path/to/file2.ts`

**Improvement Description:**
[Describe the refactoring - e.g., "Extract duplicate validation logic into shared utility function"]

**Before Refactoring:**
```typescript
// Example: Duplicate code
const validateEmail1 = (email: string) => /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
const validateEmail2 = (email: string) => /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
```

**After Refactoring:**
```typescript
// Example: Extracted utility
const validateEmail = (email: string) => /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] All tests still pass after refactoring (üü¢ GREEN maintained)
- [ ] Code is more readable/maintainable
- [ ] No new bugs introduced
- [ ] Performance improved (if applicable)

---

### Refactoring 2: [Improvement Area - e.g., "Optimize Component Rendering"]

**Files Affected:** `path/to/component.tsx`

**Improvement Description:**
[Describe the refactoring - e.g., "Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders"]

**Before Refactoring:**
```typescript
// Example: Component without memoization
export const ExpensiveComponent = (props: Props) => { /* ... */ };
```

**After Refactoring:**
```typescript
// Example: Component with memoization
export const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo((props: Props) => { /* ... */ });
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] All tests still pass (üü¢ GREEN maintained)
- [ ] Performance benchmarked (e.g., 50% fewer renders)
- [ ] No regressions in functionality

---

### REFACTOR Phase Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines (ESLint/Prettier passing)

   - Run tests after each implementation to verify they pass
   - Check off GREEN Phase Checklist items
6. **REFACTOR Phase:**
   - Identify code quality improvements

### Best Practices

- **Test-First Discipline:** NEVER write implementation code before writing tests
- **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle:** Follow the cycle strictly for each feature
- **Small Iterations:** Work on 1-2 acceptance criteria at a time
- **Frequent Test Runs:** Run tests after every code change
- **Commit Often:** Commit after each RED, GREEN, and REFACTOR phase
- **Reference Context:** Use Story Context XML as single source of truth
- **Document Deviations:** If you deviate from the plan, document why

### Example Reference

**See Story 1.11 (Establish Test Infrastructure)** as a successful example of ATDD discipline:
- File: `docs/stories/story-1.11.md`
- Context: `docs/stories/story-context-1.1.11.xml`
- Result: 42 tests passing, 100% success rate, all 14 acceptance criteria met
